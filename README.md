# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
## About
A Tic Tac Toe implementation with 4 different game modes, Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer (Easy Level), Human vs. Computer (Medium Level), and Human vs. Computer (Hard Level). The AI computer agent employs the Minimax algorithm with look ahead to play the game intelligently and displays higher intelligence at higher levels. Try to beat the computer at the hard level. Be it playing first or second; you will only manage a draw if you play intelligently! 

This project is a user-facing implementation of a research project analyzing a tradeoff between the computational complexity and agent's intelligence by increasing the look ahead levels.

## Software Details
- The Tic Tac Toe game is implemented using Python.
- The implementation provides a Command Line Interface to play the game. 

## Steps to run the game:
- Fork the Tic-Tac-Toe-AI repository 
- Locally clone your version of the Tic-Tac-Toe-AI repository 
- Open the Command Line Interface (Terminal (Macos/Ubuntu) or Command Prompt (Windows)) and navigate to the repository directory
- Type and execute the command ``` python tic_tac_toe.py``` in 
- Voila! You get excess to unlimited Tic Tac Toe games
